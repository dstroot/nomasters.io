      <description>The purpose of this project is to capture my thoughts and work on a journey towards living in accordance to a set of first principals revolving around freethought, skepticism, and libertarian socialism.
Because of my work as a technologist, this project will tend to cover topics that are technical in nature but also explore guiding principals as they relate to the focus of this project.
